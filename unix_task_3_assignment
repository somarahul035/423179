1. Shell program to check if a number is even or odd:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "$num is even"
else
  echo "$num is odd"
fi

Sample Output:
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd


2. Shell program to check if a year is a leap year:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a year:"
read year

if (( (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0) )); then
  echo "$year is a leap year"
else
  echo "$year is not a leap year"
fi

Sample Output:
Enter a year: 2024
2024 is a leap year


3. Shell program to find the factorial of a number:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number:"
read num
fact=1

for ((i=1; i<=num; i++)); do
  fact=$((fact * i))
done

echo "Factorial of $num is $fact"

Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120


4. Shell program to swap two integers:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter first number:"
read a
echo "Enter second number:"
read b

echo "Before swap: a=$a, b=$b"
temp=$a
a=$b
b=$temp
echo "After swap: a=$a, b=$b"

Sample Output:
Enter first number: 3
Enter second number: 5
Before swap: a=3, b=5
After swap: a=5, b=3


5. Shell program to compute GCD and LCM of two numbers:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter two numbers:"
read a
read b

x=$a
y=$b

while [ $b -ne 0 ]; do
  r=$((a % b))
  a=$b
  b=$r
done

gcd=$a
lcm=$(( (x * y) / gcd ))

echo "GCD is $gcd"
echo "LCM is $lcm"

Sample Output:
Enter two numbers: 12 18
GCD is 6
LCM is 36
