Aim: To install required packages using rpm/deb/apt.

How do I check if my Linux is DEB or RPM?

=> Since `dpkg -l` produces a long list of packages, our system uses `.deb` packages.

What is the difference between Linux RPM & DEB Packages?

- DEB stands for Debian and RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager.
- Both are used to manage software installations, updates, and uninstallation.
- DEB packages are used by Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, while RPM packages are used by CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- DEB packages are installed using the `dpkg` package manager, while RPM packages are installed using the `rpm` package manager.
- The `dpkg` package manager uses the `.deb` file format, which contains all the necessary files required for installation.
- Red Hat Package Manager uses the `.rpm` file format, which has all the necessary files required for installation.
- DEB packages use a system called Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) to manage dependencies.
- RPM packages use a system called Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM) to manage dependencies.
- APT and RPM download and install the dependencies on their respective systems.
- Package repositories are servers that store packages and package metadata.
- DEB packages use Debian Package Repositories to store packages and metadata.
- RPM packages use RPM Package Manager Repositories to store packages and metadata.
- DEB uses a low-level package management tool known as `dpkg`, while RPM uses the `rpm` toolâ€”both are command-line tools.
